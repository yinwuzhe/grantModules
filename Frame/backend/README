---------->The Popurse

    Why I write this little module ? It is not for tricks, although it looks like a little trick.
Do you know the one of the method of I/O Virtualization---Single Root IOV, you can get knowledges about SR_IOV in website like http://www.pcisig.com/specifications/iov/ or http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/pci-express/pci-sig-sr-iov-primer-sr-iov-technology-paper.html
  We have a little team ,that attend to make a NIC Card with the SR-IOV feature,but it difficult for us to implenment the MAILBOX mechanisam for PF2VF communications.So we intend to make the communication with software.like the grant table,shared page and event channel or IO ring,or Xenstore.
    As you already know, the SR-IOV can be implemented only in the HVMs ,so we must make sure the module can be implemented in the HVM successfully.
    After all, you can treat this like a little trick to lean about the use or mechanisam of grant table.

---------->The function of the module

    This is a module in a Domain  to get a Grant Reference from
the other doamin. And then the doamian will read the gref and port of event channel from 
the Xenstore,after this doamin will map the shared page by Hypercall.


---------->The details of the Module


---------->How to make it?

    Just run make in the shell, it will make the module to backeend.ko

---------->Load the Module

    
	 insmod ...


---------->The different Configuration in different domains

    DOM0:if both the grant domain and the granted domain are domin0, it will be an error like this:
	 xen: HYPERSIOR map grant ref failed with status -1.
	
    PVM:I haven't experimented yet

    HVM:there may be some probelems in the hvm, but to be continued----<

	WARNING: "hypercall_page" [/root/getGrant/gntgref/get_grant.ko] undefined!
WARNING: "xen_features" [/root/getGrant/gntgref/get_grant.ko] undefined!


Of course, the module could only be use in the kernel that I made myself,so,first, make fuse,you have made your own kernel.
