---------->The Popurse
    
    Why I write this little module ? It is not for tricks, although it looks like a little trick.
Do you know the one of the method of I/O Virtualization---Single Root IOV, you can get knowledges about SR_IOV in website like http://www.pcisig.com/specifications/iov/ or http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/pci-express/pci-sig-sr-iov-primer-sr-iov-technology-paper.html  We have a little team ,that attend to make a NIC Card with the SR-IOV feature,but it difficult for us to implenment the MAILBOX mechanisam for PF2VF communications.So we intend to make the communication with software.like the grant table,shared page and event channel or IO ring,or Xenstore.    As you already know, the SR-IOV can be implemented only in the HVMs ,so we must make sure the module can be implemented in the HVM successfully.    After all, you can treat this like a little trick to lean about the use or mechanisam of grant table.

---------->The Function of the module

    This is a module in a Domain  to create a Grant Reference and a event channel
and this will pass by xenstore to another Dom and then the domain  
can access the page in DomU by the GR by the event notify.


---------->How to make it?

    Just run make in the shell, it will make the module to dom-grant.ko.



---------->Load the module

    First, you should be sure that some dependent modules should be selected compiled the 
module, which are some of the the Xen driver.

	# Xen driver support
	#
	CONFIG_XEN_BALLOON=y
	CONFIG_XEN_SELFBALLOONING=y
	CONFIG_XEN_SCRUB_PAGES=y
	CONFIG_XEN_DEV_EVTCHN=y
	CONFIG_XEN_BACKEND=y
	CONFIG_XENFS=y
	CONFIG_XEN_COMPAT_XENFS=y
	CONFIG_XEN_SYS_HYPERVISOR=y
	CONFIG_XEN_XENBUS_FRONTEND=y
	CONFIG_XEN_GNTDEV=m
	CONFIG_XEN_GRANT_DEV_ALLOC=m
	CONFIG_SWIOTLB_XEN=y
	CONFIG_XEN_TMEM=y
	CONFIG_XEN_PCIDEV_BACKEND=m
	CONFIG_STAGING=y    

    For this module, you should must make sure "CONFIG_XEN_GNTDEV=m".If you did'nt insure  this thing, you may not load the module.
    Then, you can type in the console with the root previlege "insmod dom-grant.ko" to load the module.


     
-------->Dependencies
    Some of support by the Xen drivers.


-------->Some problems you may counted!

    When run module  in a domain U,the dom U kernel can't build with the dependence modules as I mentioned above. It may have some problems to solve the question, just solve it....
    Anyway, In the previleged domain all problems will be conqued easily!
